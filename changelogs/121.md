Small bugfix patch fixing a problem with arrays with the carbon configs gui accessor.

Version 1.2.1:    
- Added: BuiltIn Minecraft Color/Style support for ColorValue. So its easier to use these things. (Developer only)
- Added: A simple/expanded color table for the ColorValue Suggestions so a good base color table is provided.
- Fixed: A small bug with the array processors.

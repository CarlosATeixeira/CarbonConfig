This is a Major Rewrite of underlying systems and changing how the Parsed Elements work.   

The previous implementation for ParsedValues/ParsedArrays was simply to clunky for the users and developers.   
Now the new implementation allows a LOT more features, such as recursion/named variables and more, while being simpler to develop for.   

This was done because certain features were simply to hard to implement with it or near impossible which now have more freedom.    

This rewrite should automatically upgrade to the new implementation, but in the worst case you might have to delete/regen your carbon config files once and be done with it.    
NOTE: Forge configs are not affected by this. This is just carbon rewrite.    

Anyways times for the changelog:

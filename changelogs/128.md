Maintance patch because i got a notification that this mod was crashing with newer neoforge versions.    

Turns out neoforge rewroked the config storage and ofc removed all accessors that make things works... Thank you?!?!?!    
Welp reflection it is then :)

Changelog:   
Version 1.2.8:    
- Added: Support for multiple neoforge configs of the same type :)
- Fixed: NeoForge Incompat

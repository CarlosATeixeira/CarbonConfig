Small Maintance patch fixing a new crash introduced.     


Changelog:     
Version 1.2.9:    
- Added: Neoforge Config GUI detection and Overwrite if detected.
		This is done due the extra functionality that carbon config provides over neoforges own implementation
		Such as:
			- Editing world Configs from the main menu.
			- Editing Server Configs from the client. (Assuming permissions)
			- Editing Lan Configs
			- Editing Common Configs on the Server (Assuming permissions)
			- User Customizablity (That can be maybe improved here too :3)
- Added: Config option to disable overwriting Forge Config GUIs specifically.
- Added: Minimum Requirement for neoforge (version 110 is required for config gui changes, previous version is 109 or older)
- Fixed: Changes forge introduced for their own config gui.
